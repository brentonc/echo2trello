# echo2trello
Integrates an Amazon Echo with two trello lists

To use this you will need to rename config.sample.txt to config.txt, and correct the values it contains.
  - the amazon section contains the username/password that you use to login to echo.amazon.com
  - the trello section comes from trello.

    - getting a user token: https://trello.com/docs/gettingstarted/index.html#getting-a-token-from-a-user
  - the schedule
